# Famoco's technical exercice

## Hello Famoco's team.

You will find just [here](https://simonaertsbecode.github.io/Famoco/) my App for Famoco.

The goal was to chose an open API and display the item in a table format of 3 columns with 10 items per page. It was also asked be able to click on item and show a brief description of it.

The API that I have choosen is this one: `https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers?page=2&per_page=80`.
The **page** and **per_page** were the dynamic values that made pagination easier.

The App has been done with:

-  React
-  Redux
-  Scss

I hope you will like it as much as I liked doing it.
